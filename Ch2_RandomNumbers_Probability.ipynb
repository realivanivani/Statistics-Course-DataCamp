    "We can measure the chances of an event using probability. We can calculate the probability of some event by taking the number of ways the event can happen and dividing it by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, if we flip a coin, it can land on either heads or tails. To get the probability of the coin landing on heads, we divide the 1 way to get heads by the two possible outcomes, heads and tails. This gives us one half, or a fifty percent chance of getting heads. Probability is always between zero and 100 percent. If the probability of something is zero, it's impossible, and if the probability of something is 100%, it will certainly happen.\n",

The number itself doesn't matter. We could use 5, 139, or 3 million. The only thing that matters is that we use the same seed the next time we run the script.

    "1. Discrete distributions\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll take a deeper dive into probability and begin looking at probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rolling the dice\n",
    "Let's consider rolling a standard, six-sided die.\n",
    "There are six numbers, or six possible outcomes, and every number has one sixth, or about a 17 percent chance of being rolled. This is an example of a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Choosing salespeople\n",
    "This is similar to the scenario from earlier, except we had names instead of numbers. Just like rolling a die, each outcome, or name, had an equal chance of being chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Probability distribution\n",
    "A probability distribution describes the probability of each possible outcome in a scenario. We can also talk about the expected value of a distribution, which is the mean of a distribution. We can calculate this by multiplying each value by its probability (one sixth in this case) and summing, so the expected value of rolling a fair die is 3-point-5.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Visualizing a probability distribution\n",
    "We can visualize this using a barplot, where each bar represents an outcome, and each bar's height represents the probability of that outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Probability = area\n",
    "We can calculate probabilities of different outcomes by taking areas of the probability distribution. For example, what's the probability that our die roll is less than or equal to 2? To figure this out, we'll take the area of each bar representing an outcome of 2 or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Probability = area\n",
    "Each bar has a width of 1 and a height of one sixth, so the area of each bar is one sixth. We'll sum the areas for 1 and 2, to get a total probability of one third.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Uneven die\n",
    "Now let's say we have a die where the two got turned into a three. This means that we now have a 0% chance of getting a 2, and a 33% chance of getting a 3. To calculate the expected value of this die, we now multiply 2 by 0, since it's impossible to get a 2, and 3 by its new probability, one third. This gives us an expected value that's slightly higher than the fair die.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Visualizing uneven probabilities\n",
    "When we visualize these new probabilities, the bars are no longer even.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Adding areas\n",
    "With this die, what's the probability of getting something less than or equal to 2? There's a one sixth probability of getting 1, and zero probability of getting 2,\n",
    "which sums to one sixth.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Discrete probability distributions\n",
    "The probability distributions you've seen so far are both discrete probability distributions, since they represent situations with discrete outcomes. Recall from chapter 1 that discrete variables can be thought of as counted variables. In the case of a die, we're counting dots, so we can't roll a 1-point-5 or 4-point-3. When all outcomes have the same probability, like a fair die, this is a special distribution called a discrete uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Sampling from discrete distributions\n",
    "Just like we sampled names from a box, we can do the same thing with probability distributions like the ones we've seen. Here's a DataFrame called die that represents a fair die, and its expected value is 3-point-5. We'll sample from it 10 times to simulate 10 rolls. Notice that we sample with replacement so that we're sampling from the same distribution every time.\n",

    "We can visualize the outcomes of the ten rolls using a histogram, defining the bins we want using np-dot-linspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Sample distribution vs. theoretical distribution\n",
    "Notice that we have different numbers of 1's, 2's, 3's, and so on since the sample was random, even though on each roll we had the same probability of rolling each number. The mean of our sample is 3-point-0, which isn't super close to the 3-point-5 we were expecting.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. A bigger sample\n",
    "If we roll the die 100 times, the distribution of the rolls looks a bit more even, and the mean is closer to 3-point-5.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. An even bigger sample\n",
    "If we roll 1000 times, it looks even more like the theoretical probability distribution and the mean closely matches 3-point-5.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Law of large numbers\n",

This call will return a 1, which we'll count as a head, or a 0, which we'll count as tails.

To simulate flips with this coin, we'll adjust the second argument of binom-dot-rvs to 0-point-25. The result has lower numbers, since getting multiple heads isn't as likely with the new coin.\n",

    "The binomial distribution describes the probability of the number of successes in a sequence of independent trials. In other words, it can tell us the probability of getting some number of heads in a sequence of coin flips. Note that this is a discrete distribution since we're working with a countable outcome. The binomial distribution can be described using two parameters, n and p. n represents the total number of trials being performed, and p is the probability of success. n and p are also the third and second arguments of binom-dot-rvs. Here's what the distribution looks like for 10 coins. We have the biggest chance of getting 5 heads total, and a much smaller chance of getting 0 heads or 10 heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What's the probability of 7 heads?\n",
    "To get the probability of getting 7 heads out of 10 coins, we can use binom-dot-pmf. The first argument is the number of heads or successes. The second argument is the number of trials, n, and the third is the probability of success, p. If we flip 10 coins, there's about a 12% chance that exactly 7 of them will be heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # binom.pmf(num heads, num trials, prob of heads)\n",
    "    >> binom.pmf(7, 10, 0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What's the probability of 7 or fewer heads?\n",
    "binom-dot-cdf gives the probability of getting a number of successes less than or equal to the first argument. The probability of getting 7 or fewer heads out of 10 coins is about 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> binom.cdf(7, 10, 0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What's the probability of more than 7 heads?\n",
    "We can take 1 minus the probability of getting 7 or fewer heads to get the probability of a number of successes greater than the first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >> 1 - binom.cdf(7, 10, 0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Expected value\n",
    "The expected value of the binomial distribution can be calculated by multiplying n times p. The expected number of heads we'll get from flipping 10 coins is 10 times 0-point-5, which is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Independence\n",
    "It's important to remember that in order for the binomial distribution to apply, each trial must be independent, so the outcome of one trial shouldn't have an effect on the next. For example, if we're picking randomly from these cards with zeros and ones, we have a 50-50 chance of getting a 0 or a 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Independence\n",
    "But since we're sampling without replacement, the probabilities for the second trial are different due to the outcome of the first trial. Since these trials aren't independent, we can't calculate accurate probabilities for this situation using the binomial distribution.\n",
